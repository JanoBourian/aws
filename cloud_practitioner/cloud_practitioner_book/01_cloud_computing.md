# What Is Cloud Computing?

* Maybe the most difficult challenges are the security and the network connectivity.
* Cloud Computing: describes the on-demand access to IT services that comprise:
    * Compute
    * Network
    * Storage
    * Software

Six advantages of cloud computing:
* Trade capital expenses for variable expenses
* Stop guessing the capacity
* Scale economies
* Stop to spend money to mantain servers
* Agility and velocity
* Go global in seconds

# Virtualization

* Hypervisor is reponsible for enabling the operating systems and applications running on VMs.
* Key concepts: 
    * Elasticity
    * Automation
    * Scalability
    * High Availability (HA)

# Exploring cloud computing models

* Iaas:
    * You should configure the operating system, storage, network, and compute services
    * Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS), and Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)
* PaaS:
    * You do not need to configure: network, firewall rules, storage, compute services, operating system management, and runtime environments.
    * Examples: AWS Beanstalk, AWS OpsWork, AWS Lambda, and Amazon RDS
* SaaS:
    * Amazon Chime

# Cloud deployment models

* Public Cloud
* Private Cloud
* Hybrid Cloud
* Multi-Cloud
